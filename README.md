# Sudoku-Solver-with-GUI

This project is a Sudoku solver programmed in Java that can handle standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. It uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find a solution to any valid puzzle. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Java Swing, allowing users to easily input puzzles.

# Feutures

* Handles puzzles with ease and guarantees a solution if the puzzle is valid.
* A clean GUI built with Java Swing for intuitive puzzle input.
* Displays error messages if an invalid puzzle is entered.
* Powered by a robust backtracking algorithm to quickly solve puzzles.

# Algorithm Explanation

* The algorithm starts at the first empty cell.
* It tries filling the cell with numbers 1 through 9, checking if each choice is valid.
* After placing a number, the algorithm recursively attempts to solve the rest of the grid.
* If there is a issue or no solution is found, it "backtracks" by resetting the current cell and trying the next number.
* This process repeats until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are tried.
